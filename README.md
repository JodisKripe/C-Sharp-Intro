## Naming Conventions

C# uses different text casing depending on where it's being declared. Here is a summary of the conventions:

Object Casing
Classes PascalCase
Public Members PascalCase
Private Members \_camelCase
Methods PascalCase
Variables camelCase
Enums PascalCase

We'll see many of these other types as we progress through the course.
